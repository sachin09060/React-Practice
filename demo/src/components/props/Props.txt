React Props:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Props stand for "Properties."
* They are read-only components.
* It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components.
* It is similar to function arguments. Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.
* Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.
