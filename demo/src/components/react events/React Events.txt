React Events
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* An event is an action that could be triggered as a result of the user action or system generated event. 
    For example, a mouse click, loading of a web page, pressing a key, window resizes, and other interactions are called events.

* React has its own event handling system which is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.

* he react event handling system is known as Synthetic Events. 
    The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser's native event.
