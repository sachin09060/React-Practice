React Forms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Forms allows the users to interact with the application as well as gather information from the users.
* Forms can perform many tasks that depend on the nature of your business requirements and logic such as
     authentication of the user, adding user, searching, filtering, booking, ordering, etc.
* A form can contain text fields, buttons, checkbox, radio button, etc.

Creating Form:
    There are mainly two types of form input in React.

   1. Uncontrolled component:
        -> The DOM itself holds control over the data.
        -> It maintains its internal state.
        -> It does not allow validation control.
        -> It stores the current value using react ref.
        -> It has limited control over the form data.
        -> Not predictable because form elements can lose their reference or may be changed/ affected by external sources during the lifecycle of components.


   2. Controlled component:
        -> Here, data is controlled by the parent component.
        -> It does not maintain its internal state.
        -> It allows validation control.
        -> It stores the current value in the form of props / It accepts its current value as a prop..
        -> It has better control over the form elements and data.
        -> Predictable because the component handles the form data at every step.


Conclusion
     * React supports two ways to handle the form data, it can either be a Controlled component or an Uncontrolled component.
     * React provides two distinctively flexible solutions, i.e., model-view (controlled) and only-view (uncontrolled).
     * Controlled components have a one-way data flow where the state inside the component serves as the single source of truth.
     * The parent component has held over the form data in the controlled component.
     * The DOM itself handles all the form data in an uncontrolled component.
     * It can become cumbersome to work with controlled components if there are many input fields on the page.
     * Controlled component react provides validation benefits on every keystroke of the user.
     * All the state changes in a controlled component are made with the help of the setState() method.
     * An uncontrolled component stores the current value of the form data using react ref.
     * Uncontrolled component react are helpful when we need to integrate react with other libraries which do not follow react design patterns.
