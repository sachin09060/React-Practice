React State
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component.
* When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
* State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. 
    But you shouldnâ€™t change objects that you hold in the React state directly.
    Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), 
    and then set the state to use that copy.

React State Hook
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Mutation : You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.

useState
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Call useState at the top level of your component to declare a state variable.

* useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

* Parameters :
    -> initialState: The value you want the state to be initially. 
        It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. 
        This argument is ignored after the initial render.

    -> If you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. 
         It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. 
         React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state.
